        <h1>Welcome, Home Defender!</h1>
        <p>You have successfully unlocked <strong>Pillar 2: Fortify Your Fortress</strong>. This training moves from deterrence to physical, technical security, focusing on eliminating the <strong>Breach Window</strong>â€”the time an intruder has to gain entry before being stopped or identified. Start your training below.</p>

        <section class="module-section">
            <h2>Module 2.1: Advanced Entry Point Hardening: Door & Frame Dynamics</h2>
            <p>Approximately 70% of home invasions occur through the front or back door. This module provides a professional-grade methodology for converting standard residential doors into a **Ballistic/Forced-Entry Resistant** system designed to counter blunt force and tactical entry methods.</p>

            <div class="key-concept">
                <strong>The Structural Triad:</strong> True door security depends on three points of failure working in concert: the **Lock** (deadbolt), the **Frame** (jamb and strike plate), and the **Hinges**. The weakest point is almost always the frame's anchor to the house, which can be overcome by a swift 200 ft-lb kick.
            </div>

            <h3>Deadbolt and Strike Plate Reinforcement (The Anchor Point)</h3>
            <p>The standard residential strike plate is secured by tiny 1-inch screws into soft jamb wood. We must upgrade this into a structural anchor point:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High-Security Deadbolts:</strong> Insist on a **Grade 1 commercial-rated deadbolt**. Key features are a 1-inch minimum bolt throw, hardened steel roller pins inside the bolt (to resist sawing), and a free-spinning steel cylinder housing (to resist drilling/wrenching).</li>
                <li><strong>The Extended Strike Plate Mandate:</strong> This is non-negotiable. Replace the standard plate with a **heavy-gauge steel security plate system** (L-shaped or wrap-around) that extends 18 to 24 inches up and down the door jamb.</li>
                <li><strong>Anchor Penetration:</strong> The security plate must be secured by **no fewer than six 3.5-inch to 4-inch structural screws**. These screws must penetrate through the thin door jamb, through the shims, and **anchor at least 1.5 inches deep into the structural studs** (king and jack studs) of the rough opening.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Securing the Hinge Side (The Pivot Point)</h3>
            <p>If the lock side is reinforced, an intruder may attempt to attack the hinge side to split the door frame.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hinge Pin Replacement:</strong> Every single hinge on the door must have at least two existing screws replaced with **3.5-inch structural screws** to tie the hinge, jamb, and stud together. This prevents the frame from separating under pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Hinge Reinforcement Pins:</strong> For ultimate security (especially on inward-swinging doors), install two small metal pins (or specialized hinge bolts) per door that lock the door slab to the frame when the door is closed. This mechanically stops the door from being pushed through the frame even if the hinges and strike plate are damaged.</li>
                <li>**Outswing Doors (Vulnerability Mitigation):** If your door swings out, replace standard pins with **non-removable security pins** or use set screws in the hinge leaves to mechanically bind the pins, making them impossible to drive out from the exterior.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Door Slab Integrity</h3>
            <p>A reinforced frame is useless if the door itself can be easily defeated.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Solid Core/Steel Mandate:** Exterior doors should be **solid wood core** or **steel/fiberglass with a solid core foam filling**. Hollow-core doors offer zero resistance to force and are unacceptable for exterior access.</li>
                <li>**Mail Slots and Pet Doors:** These are structural liabilities. If you must have them, ensure the mail slot is backed by metal receiving box on the interior, and the pet door is secured with a **steel security panel** that locks from the inside. They are often targets for lock manipulation or reconnaissance.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="module-takeaways">
                <h3>Module Takeaways 2.1</h3>
                <p><strong>Core Principle:</strong> The single most effective action to prevent a kick-in is installing a **24-inch extended strike plate** secured with **4-inch structural screws** that anchor the lock point directly to the home's structural framing.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="module-section">
            <h2>Module 2.2: Ballistic & Impact Resistance: Window and Secondary Entry Defense</h2>
            <p>Windows, sliding doors, and the garage are non-traditional entry points that offer the intruder a softer target. This module details the technical specifications and layering required to elevate these areas to the same resistance level as the primary door.</p>

            <h3>Advanced Window Glazing Reinforcement</h3>
            <p>Standard glass is defeated instantly. Our objective is to deny the intruder rapid entry by forcing a high time commitment.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Security Window Film Application:</strong> Use **minimum 12-mil thick security film** (polyethylene terephthalate) on all ground-floor, second-story accessible (near a roof/deck), and vulnerable windows. The film is applied to the interior, bonding to the frame.</li>
                <li><strong>The Failure Mechanism:</strong> When struck, the glass will spiderweb but remain largely intact and attached to the film and the frame. The intruder must then use a tool (not just their fist) to saw or tear through the resilient film, significantly increasing noise and the **Breach Window** time from 2 seconds to 45-90 seconds.</li>
                <li>**Lattice/Grille Defense:** For high-risk basement or ground-level windows, install permanently mounted, non-egress metal grilles or reinforced steel screens. **Ensure all habitable rooms have compliant egress (fire escape) methods.**</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Sliding Glass Door (SGD) and French Door Protocol</h3>
            <p>SGDs are particularly weak due to flimsy locks and their ease of being lifted off the track.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lock Upgrade:</strong> Do not rely on the factory lock. Install a secondary, surface-mounted, key-operated lock (e.g., a "Charley Bar" type mechanism or a commercial deadlock) near the center or bottom of the door.</li>
                <li><strong>Vertical Barricade:</strong> Use a high-density, **square-cut metal bar** (not a wooden dowel) placed in the bottom track. The square cut prevents rotation and slippage.</li>
                <li>**Anti-Lift Pinning:** Drill two small holes (one on each side) through the inner sliding track and insert screws or specialized security pins just above the door's track rollers. This prevents the door from being leveraged upward and off the track.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Garage and Utility Access Points</h3>
            <p>The garage offers **maximum concealment** for a breach attempt. The door from the garage to the house and exterior utility doors (e.g., side door) are high-priority targets.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Garage-to-Home Door Mandate:</strong> This door must be a **solid core, fire-rated door** (minimum 20-minute rating). It must have a Grade 1 deadbolt, and both the strike plate and all hinges must be anchored with **4-inch structural screws** into the studs.</li>
                <li>**Overhead Garage Door:** Secure the emergency release handle with a small zip tie that can be broken from the inside in an emergency but prevents a coat hanger attack from the outside. Add a separate, heavy-duty sliding bolt lock or padlock to the track when on vacation.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="module-takeaways">
                <h3>Module Takeaways 2.2</h3>
                <p><strong>Core Principle:</strong> Non-traditional entry points require **layered time-delaying defenses**. Security film increases the window breach time from 2 seconds to over 45 seconds, while the garage-to-home door must meet the **Grade 1 exterior security standard**.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="module-section">
            <h2>Module 2.3: Integrated Technical Security: Smart Systems and Redundancy</h2>
            <p>Modern security systems must function as a cohesive, redundant network of sensors, cameras, and communication devices. This module focuses on system reliability, anti-sabotage measures, and effective deployment strategy.</p>

            <h3>Advanced Camera Deployment Strategy (Forensic Capture)</h3>
            <p>Effective surveillance is about capturing undeniable evidence, not just deterring the casual observer.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Anti-Sabotage Placement:</strong> Mount cameras high (<strong>9-12 feet</strong>) and use ceiling/soffit overhangs for physical protection from rain and attempts to knock them down. Use **tamper-proof mounting brackets** and security screws.</li>
                <li><strong>Overlapping Fields of View (FOV):</strong> Every key access point (front door, driveway, back patio) must be covered by **two separate cameras**. If one camera is disabled or obscured, the other, potentially further back, can capture the forensic evidence.</li>
                <li><strong>WDR/HDR Functionality:</strong> Ensure cameras support **WDR (Wide Dynamic Range)** or **HDR (High Dynamic Range)**. This is crucial for handling high-contrast situations (like a backlit porch) that would otherwise wash out the intruder's face.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Storage Redundancy:</strong> Do not rely solely on cloud storage. Implement an **on-site Network Video Recorder (NVR)** or local SD card storage within the camera. If the internet or power is cut, your forensic evidence is preserved locally.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Alarm System Reliability and Response Protocol</h3>
            <p>An alarm system is a notification tool. Its value is measured by its **Reliability (low false alarms)** and **Speed of Response (fast notification)**.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dual Path Communication:</strong> Use systems that communicate via both **cellular/LTE backup** and Wi-Fi/Internet. If the phone line/internet is cut, the alarm still communicates through the cellular path.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Sensors:</strong> Place **glass break sensors** on all vulnerable windows in addition to traditional contact sensors. A contact sensor is defeated if the glass is cut silently, but a glass break sensor detects the frequency of shattered glass.</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-Programmed Response:</strong> For self-monitored systems, have a written **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**: If Alarm X trips, immediately call Contact 1; if Motion Y trips within 30 seconds of Alarm X, immediately call 911/authorities.</li>
                <li>**System Integration:** Integrate the alarm trigger with smart lighting (flashing bright cool-white lights inside and out) and your camera recording to create a disorienting, high-visibility event upon breach.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="module-takeaways">
                <h3>Module Takeaways 2.3</h3>
                <p><strong>Core Principle:</strong> Effective surveillance requires **overlapping fields of view** from cameras mounted **9-12 feet high** with **WDR/HDR** capabilities, and the alarm system must utilize **Dual Path Communication** (cellular/LTE) to prevent anti-sabotage failure.</p>
