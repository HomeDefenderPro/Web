        <h1>Welcome, Home Defender!</h1>
        <p>You have successfully unlocked **Pillar 1: Environmental Control**. This training focuses on preemptive security—making your property the hardest, riskiest, and least appealing target. **This is advanced deterrence.**</p>

        <section class="module-section">
            <h2>Module 1.1: Pre-Incident & Home Selection Tactics</h2>
            <p>The most crucial decision is where you live. This module focuses on the **Low-Hanging Fruit Analysis**, teaching you to assess vulnerability based on location, public access, and visible affluence.</p>

            <div class="key-concept">
                <strong>The Low-Hanging Fruit Analysis:</strong> Your home must be perceived by a potential intruder as requiring too much time and posing too much risk relative to the reward. We aim to fail the criminal's **OODA Loop** before they even approach the front gate.
            </div>

            <h3>Geographic Vulnerability and Home Selection</h3>
            <p>A beautiful home with a high-value vehicle parked directly outside is an **Affluence Signal**. When this signal is near a dense population hub or a **Public Transit System**, you become an immediate target. Proximity to public transit provides the criminal with a critical element: **Avenue of Escape (AoE)**. Before purchasing a home, use mapping tools to analyze all AoEs within a 5-block radius. A successful home defense starts with a successful home selection that lacks easy escape vectors.</p>

        <section class="module-section">
            <h2>Module 1.2: Identifying & Eliminating Common Blind Spots</h2>
            <p>A blind spot is any area where a trespasser can linger unobserved for **60 seconds or more**—this is the window they use to study interior movement or tamper with locks. This module provides a professional methodology for threat mapping.</p>

            <h3>The 360-Degree Sweep Methodology</h3>
            <p>Your analysis must be methodical. Use a structured, four-corner approach to identify and map all surveillance and approach-based blind spots.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>**The Night Walkthrough:** Walk your perimeter after dark with a flashlight. Look specifically for **deep shadows** cast by structures, dense landscaping, or fences.</li>
                <li>**Vulnerability Mapping:** Create a simple map of your property and mark all spots where a person could hide completely. Focus on areas near main entry points, below windows, and around utility boxes.</li>
                <li>**Shadow Control:** Place lighting (covered in Module 1.4) specifically to **move shadows away from the structure**, forcing any trespasser to operate in a fully exposed area, denying them concealment.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A proper analysis denies the intruder the critical time they need to execute their plan.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="module-section">
            <h2>Module 1.3: Advanced Landscaping Techniques for Security</h2>
            <p>Your garden should serve as an obstacle course, not a hiding place. This module moves beyond aesthetics to utilize landscaping as an active, passive security layer.</p>

            <h3>The Defensive Layering Technique (D-L-T)</h3>
            <p>Structure your property's perimeter into two defensive layers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Layer 1 (Near the House):** The "Visibility Layer." Use low-growing plants (less than 2 feet) that cannot conceal a person, ensuring clear sightlines to all first-floor windows.</li>
                <li>**Layer 2 (The Perimeter/Fence Line):** The "Impediment Layer." Use **Barrier Plants**—dense, thorny, or unpleasant-to-touch foliage (e.g., barberry, holly, or pyracantha) to create a physical obstacle that requires noise and time to breach.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Audible Security:</strong> Strategically place a **2-foot wide path of decorative gravel** beneath vulnerable first-floor windows. The crunching sound is a non-electronic, always-on alarm, providing immediate auditory feedback of an approach.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="module-section">
            <h2>Module 1.4: Non-Obvious Lighting Strategies to Deter Intrusion</h2>
            <p>The goal is to eliminate all **hiding spots**, not just to shine a light. This module details advanced techniques for light placement and timing that confuse and expose intruders.</p>

            <h3>Shadow Elimination and Deception</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>'Washing' vs. 'Spotlighting':</strong> Avoid harsh spotlights, which create deep, dense shadows. Use **Wall-Washing** techniques with exterior fixtures to create uniform, shadow-free illumination that removes all hiding places along the home's surface.</li>
                <li><strong>Interior Deception:</strong> Use **multiple staggered timers** on varied indoor lights (e.g., one floor lamp on at 6:30 PM, a kitchen light on at 7:15 PM, a bedroom light on at 8:00 PM). This simulates complex, irregular, human occupancy patterns that are far more convincing than a single, static timer.</li>
                <li>**Color Temperature:** Opt for brighter, whiter light temperatures (**4000K-5000K**, or "cool white") in exterior security lighting. This spectrum is a greater psychological deterrent than warm, yellow light.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="module-section">
            <h2>Module 1.5: Auditing Your Social Media and Digital Footprint</h2>
            <p>Intruders today use **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)** to profile targets. Your goal is **Intelligence Denial**. This module teaches you how to audit your online presence as a professional threat analyst would.</p>

            <h3>The OSINT Denial Protocol</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>**Social Media Privacy Audit:** Log out and view your profiles. Scrub all photos of high-value items (interior electronics, safes, car keys) and eliminate all **image metadata** (which can contain precise location data) from shared photos.</li>
                <li>**Location Data Suppression:** Disable all geotagging functions on your camera and social media apps. For added security, employ **"Chaff"**—intentionally misleading location tags or check-ins that confuse a remote profiling attempt.</li>
                <li>**The Vacation Blackout Protocol:** A strict period of social media silence that begins **two weeks before** you leave and ends **one week after** you return. Never advertise an empty home in real-time.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="module-section">
            <h2>Module 1.6: Community Defense and Intelligence Control</h2>
            <p>This module focuses on managing external factors: the neighborhood network and the sensitive information leaving your home (trash/mail).</p>

            <h3>Setting up Neighborhood Watch and Community Defense</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>**Secure Tiered Communication:** Establish a secure communication channel (encrypted app) with trusted neighbors and define **Tiers of Response** (e.g., Tier 1: Active Threat; Tier 2: Suspicious Activity).</li>
                <li>**Mutual Surveillance Agreements:** Formalize an agreement for reciprocal home-watching during the day and during vacations, including a detailed reporting protocol.</li>
                <li>**Anomaly Identification:** Train yourself and neighbors to look for **"Out-of-Place Elements"** (unfamiliar cars, misplaced objects used as markers) rather than relying on vague "suspicious people."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mastering Mail and Trash Management Protocols (Intelligence Denial)</h3>
            <p>Your trash is a goldmine for profilers. Stop giving them free information.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**The Shredding Mandate:** Shred *everything* with your name, address, or account numbers.</li>
                <li>**Concealment and Opaque Bags:** Never place high-value item packaging (e.g., new TV box) directly on the curb. **Break down all boxes, place them inside opaque trash bags,** and then inside the trash bin to deny an easy inventory of your assets.</li>
                <li>**Mail Interception:** Utilize a secure, locked residential mailbox or a PO Box/Commercial Mail Receiving Agency to sever the link between your home's physical location and your personal documentation.</li>
            </ul>
